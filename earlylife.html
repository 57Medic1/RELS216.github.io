                <p>Giovanni Bernardone was born in 1182 in Assisi, Italy into a wealthy merchant family. Upon his father's return from France, Giovanni was renamed Francisco 'Francis' by his father. With plans to inherit his father's cloth business, he lived a lavith youth. Francis was blinded by dreams of success, knighthood and nobility.</p>
                <p>Often thought of as a 'wild youth' Francis was an alpha male who loved jokes and having a fun time. He lived during a period where the world around him was plagued with war, fighting, disease and death. Even under these circumstances, the 'king of revels' as he was often called, thrived with his playboy and leadership nature.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">Francis dreamed of being a soldier, but God had other plans. During his sleep, Jesus came to Francis and said to him 'Serve the master and not the man.' This is when Francis' life would change forever</p>
